For some people, the idea of speaking at a conference might seem daunting. Squeaky microphones, big echoey rooms, clunky podiums, challenging AV and terrible Q&As all flash into our minds. However, UnTechCon is not a typical conference. In fact, it is an UNconference, and we hope that people’s experiences here will be very different, and a whole lot more comfortable. We want this event to be as welcoming as possible for all — not just to attend, but also to contribute. The whole point of an UnConference is that the lines between guests and speakers are blurred — everyone is a participant, and there is space for everyone to speak up. So if you have even the tiniest seed of an idea which you feel relates to the themes and topics we’re interested in, we want to hear your voice on December 10th, and we want you you feel as at-ease as possible about making a contribution!

### We have a low bar to entry/low expectations

This is our first event. Though we want as many people as possible to attend, realistically the vast majority of attendees will be ‘friends and family’ of the GFSC collective. We seek to foster a welcoming and celebratory atmosphere, where even half-formed or still developing ideas will be welcomed eagerly. As long as your politics align with ours (anti-racist, trans-and-disability positive + + +), your words will be met kindly and supportively by the audience here. There may be friendly discussion in the chat, but it will all be coming from a positive place.

### We want to try and minimise AV stress

The entire event is being run on Discord, which eliminates a lot of the typical meatspace AV concerns. That said, we will be opening a test channel the day before where speakers can drop by during pre-arranged hours to test how everything works and make sure they are comfortable with all the video channel interfaces, plus to ask any other questions they might have about tech stuff for the event. It’s worth noting that the Discord app is a lot better than using Discord in a browser for this stuff, so we strongly recommend anyone who plans to present installs the app (and visits our test channel the day before!) There will also be room moderators and tech support available throughout the event itself, should anyone need support on the day.

### Your tech background is irrelevant

Though we have the word ‘tech’ in the title of the event, we welcome and actively encourage contributions from those who might not think of themselves as traditionally part of the ‘tech’ world. Maybe you have no experience of building tech but a LOT of experience of how tech works (or doesn’t work) in support of your IRL community’s aims and goals. Maybe you have experience of breaking away from tech to do more work offline, with tech now serving as a background admin tool rather than front and centre. Maybe you simply have some ideas about what tech could and should be, were it to genuinely serve you/your community. No matter what your ideas, we want to hear them. 

### Think you have no time? Think again!

Maybe you have a great idea and would love to speak, but feel like you don’t have any time to prepare? Not a problem at an unconf! No fancy presentations required here (indeed, no presentations required at all if you don’t want one/have time to make one), and we welcome contributions with a minimum length of 5 minutes, up to a maximum of 20 minutes. This means that even if you barely have time to prepare any notes, you can speak off the cuff for a short period and simply introduce us to your area/ideas in your own, free-flowing words. 

### Top tips for first time/anxious speakers

David Hayward has kindly shared some top tips for first time speakers, which we reproduce an edited version of with permission below. 

- If you do want to pre-write your talk and you're struggling, the classic ‘beginning, middle and end’ (or ‘intro-middle-conclusion’) structure is a very old and reliable one. Open it with something you think is interesting, flesh out your points in the middle, then tie it all together at the end. When writing talks like this, more often than not, the intro has only come to me after writing the middle and end.
- Take a few deep, calming breaths before you start speaking. Pause, look at the audience (or in this case, your discord screen) and take in that sight before you start. It's natural to be a bit nervous, and if someone gets to the point with public speaking that they're not, that's kind of a bad sign anyway (it can mean they don’t care, and that can be really obvious).
- Some people's speech accelerates madly when they're doing public speaking, so try to pace yourself and pause. Pausing is a really effective way to let a point sink in.
- Avoid any slides you use having bullet pointed lists (like this one) on them. Lists are among the dullest things to look at in the universe.
- Finishing before your time is up is never a problem: You can thank the audience, then ask if anyone has any questions.
- Speaking too long can also be an issue — at this event, no talk slots are longer than 20 minutes, and even for shorter slots, it’s important to try and keep to time. Being rushed might make you fluff your conclusion!
- Practice your talk in advance, to check the timing. As mentioned, you'll probably talk a little faster when you doing it for real. While you’re practicing, try not to be note bound. Speak to your audience, don't read to them.
- If you’re struggling to break free of notes, you can write out your entire talk long form in advance, and practice with that. Each time though, try and look at your written version less and less frequently — you'll probably deviate from your intended wording and maybe forget to speak an entire paragraph or something. In the latter case, probably no one will notice, and in the former, extemporising is good. Extemporising is a pretty advanced public speaking skill that hinges on not just memorising your talk, but memorising its structure and being able to riff on the outline of it without necessarily knowing your exact words in advance. The more natural your speech is, the easier it will be to connect to the audience and make them feel involved.
- Having all of my slides as images with no text has sometimes been an easy shortcut to extemporising for me. Imagery slips into long term memory much more easily than encoded information like text or numbers. Each image you use can remind you what to talk about while preserving some overall structure, though this method still requires rehearsal to avoid it getting messy or wandering into digressions. Imagery rather than text will make your talk more memorable for the audience too.
