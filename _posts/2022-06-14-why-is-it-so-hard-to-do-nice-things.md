_This article is a bloggified version of the talk I gave at [EMF 2022](https://www.emfcamp.org/schedule/2022/239-why-is-it-so-hard-to-do-nice-things-that-make-a-difference) aimed at a hacker/maker/creator community. It's a bit rougher and more personal than our usual posts, so I hope you like it, and I would love to talk to you all about it over the following months._

## Part 1: on the desire to do *stuff*

I started Geeks for Social Change in about 2016, first as a meetup group, then a reading group, then a research and design studio, and now a collective and studio combo (more on this soon). This came out of a desire to blend together activism, tech and research in groups I was in to make things better and create truly community-led tech. I’m basically a scrappy activist deeply embedded in feminist, trans, abolitionist, antiracist politics, who couldn’t see myself represented anywhere in tech, and found so called “tech for good” hitting extremely wide of the mark. I'm now just about ready to start getting all these feelings out my head and onto the page.

Like a lot of long term activists, I was also very burnt out from activism and wanted to do something joyful and fun, to be able to deliver projects with a very “fully automated luxury queer communism” vibe. To get away from the coalface a lot of activism can find itself stuck at, and make a place to actually start building the world we want to live in rather than just fighting the old one.

### Making as a basis for joy

I like to think almost everyone has some form of making, coding, producing, sewing, sculpting, knitting, instrument playing, or other arts and crafts process, as a coping mechanism. An activity that's just for _you_ that brings _you_ joy for its own sake.

It feels like we can’t change a lot in the world at the moment and things are pretty grim, but we can at least make some cool doodads. The process of making (or producing) can be therapeutic, keeps us mindful, lets us use our hands, work in non-hierarchical ways, and generally fuck around and find out with low stakes. 

I think this is potentially a really really deep form of interacting with the world and at the core of what gives our life meaning. However, we are not really living in a society that allows this joy to be at the forefront of our lives, making it something we have to fit into the cracks.

> "We live in a world which is generally disagreeable, where not only people but the established powers have a stake in transmitting sad affects to us. Sadness, sad affects, are all those which reduce our power to act. The established powers need our sadness to make us slaves. The tyrant, the priest, the captors of souls need to persuade us that life is hard and a burden. The powers that be need to repress us no less than to make us anxious … to administer and organize our intimate little fears.”

[^d88]: Deleuze, Gilles (1988). _Spinoza: Practical Philosophy_. City Lights Books, San Francisco. [Download](https://monoskop.org/images/d/d8/Deleuze_Gilles_Spinoza_Practical_Philosophy.pdf)

Deleuze talks here about "the power to act" as the basis of our entire being. Whether we want the power to eat a burger, play with our phones, design a shader on stage, build something out of scaffolding, turn some mercury into gold, or whatever else people did at EMF Camp, we are fundamentally empowered or limited by our collective and personal power to act.

### Doing stuff as an escape from the drudgery

I think the effort that is currently needed to begin and maintain these things that bring us joy is really something that needs attention. Especially given many people have jobs they hate and they do stuff in the evenings or weekend to feel valued. David Graeber for example points out that the more you get paid, the less likely your job is to improve society[^bsjobs]. Our ease of being able to do these things that bring us joy drastically affects both our perception of the world and feeling of control over it.

[^bsjobs]: Graeber, David (2018). _Bullshit Jobs_. Simon & Schuster.

Making is for many our escape from oppressive power structures. Almost every talk in the EMF program is not someone’s day job, or if it is they’ve had to jump through burning hoops to make it their day job. This is what we do for fun. Isn’t it mad that these niche interests, the things that bring us joy, and that bring a field of people together, are pushed so far from the margins that we can’t even imaging this being the main thing we do? We have a potential wellspring of new ideas and the people who want to make a better world, and yet that space is pushed right to the margins.

The joy I'm talking about here isn't the joy you get from going to a party or taking drugs, say. I’m talking about the satisfaction of setting your mind to a hard problem and fixing it. This is about the stuff that gives life meaning and makes you feel alive, gives you agency over months and years, not days and weeks. Doing good projects that matter and accomplishing things you thought previously impossible can be one of the most rewarding things there is. Anyone whose been part of putting on a big event or producing some collective artwork generally has a huge sense of pride about it. These are the things that form part if our identities, and change who we are, how we think, and what we think possible.

So in summary: doing and making stuff not just fun but possibly a basic form of interacting with the rest of the universe. Capitalism is bad, and gets in the way of this. If you think this sounds like communism or anarchism, yes you’re probably right.

---

## Part 2: on the difficulties doing the *stuff* with *other people*

A completely reasonable desire given the joy of doing things is then to want to do things with other people. And this is where it gets messy, because people are messy and relationships are hard. 

This might be setting up a hack space, forming a D&D group or knitting circle, going LARPing, making a Minecraft server, or just organising a weekly meetup at the pub. We could call this 'apolitical' organising (although obviously everything is political!).

It could also be trying to mobilise some friends to go to a protest, form a mutual aid group or trans clothes swap, put on a zine fair, or organise a vaguely political film festival or club night for a minoritised group. We could call this 'political' organising. As you can see there’s really no clear distinction between the two but let’s go with it for now.

While the core of the activities is very different, the actual activity becomes the same: building relationships and organising communities. Again, these relationships are usually the ones that give our lives meaning -— doing fun things things with like with people we love is the one of the best feelings on earth. In other words: the work becomes more about relationships and less about the original activity we started with.

We’re not really taught how to work cooperatively at any point in our educational or work systems. Despite the fact it’s more or less the default way of working between friends and hobby groups, we don’t really learn about different ways of doing consensus or consent, conflict resolution, restorative justice, or a bunch of other stuff that would really help. So it can be tricky because we’re just short of tools and experience and we’re short of other people to help fix things when stuff goes wrong. So just as it can be great organising things, it can also suck. A lot. 

It is this relationship work that is the thing the rest of this talk will really focus on.

### Communities of Place and Interest

We all exist within communities of place, and communities of interest. These both deserve a bit of attention and thought as to how they differ.

Communities of place are, basically, where we live. This is our immediate neighbourhood, the things we walk past every day. This used to be the main space for what we would consider “community life” but now to many can feel really alienating. I live in a very mixed inner city area (Hulme in Manchester) and see up close how age determines where and how far people will travel — the student population keeps itself to itself (not half because of the gigantic fences erected by the university) and socialises in the city centre while older people, especially minoritied ethnic groups, end up living near each other in ways that are invisible to outsiders. 

This is self-selecting in itself — postcode at birth is still the single biggest predictor of your life chances and choices — but in the rareified world we live in it feels like this can be the closest thing we have to meeting people outside our self-selecting hobby and identity groups.

Communities of Interest are what they sound like. The stuff I talked about in the first section of this paper. The rise of the internet has made these far far easier to do (and sort of shoved out the ones of place for those who are really online). The locus of attention is the interest or hobby itself, and creates its own habitus that transcends any one place.

The interplay between the two can be hard, and is why I think it feels so hard to do stuff right now. We are sort of in a new era where such a large proportion of the population is a bit too online, in ways that are entirely controlled by gigantic oppressive companies, who directly set what behaviours are possible and impossible. This has both increased alienation between the on and offliners, as communities of place all of a sudden seem really difficult to engage with. Safer to stay talking to my friends where its safe.

On some level we are all working in a crossover of the two. The size of the geography expands as the size of our interest gets more niche. So for example it doesn’t make any sense for me to think about trans organising in my ward, there’s just not enough people (ok, where I live specifically there might be but in general not). As a group that is 0.3-0.5% of the population we need to cast a net over wider areas. But if I’m thinking about protecting local parks or meeting neighbours for coffee I’m thinking you know, 200m from my house. And I’m also expecting people outside that radius to not really care where I go for coffee or to a park because they have their own. But these interest-based groups silo fast, and then get more and more niche, and eventually scene drama somehow becomes your life.

And then let’s just not leave it unsaid…

### Doing stuff right now, under a Tory government

I hope it is not controversial to say: politics in the UK (and world) *fucking sucks* right now.

We live in extremely disempowering times. It feels like it’s hard to talk about possibility and change right now as we spend so long struggling to exist: the intersecting cost of living crisis, ongoing pandemic, corrupt and fascist government, social isolation and loneliness crisis, upswing in structural racism and hate crime, and highly coordinated and well funded attacks on trans people are creating an incredibly intolerant environment. Covid has torn apart a lot of the normal functionings of how people go and find communities of place and hyperfocussed the ones of interest. 

I think a lot of us, especially those who are perhaps two or more of trans, disabled, of colour, neurodivergent, working class, queer, carers, and other marginalised groups have never been further from representation at the ballot box. This is the rant part of the talk before I get talking about more constructive things. The Labour Party in waiting looks like Tory-lite, and on some issues is more right wing than the Tory party. The minority parties never look like serious contenders on any issues and don’t seem to have any real teeth outside of just “not that guy”, and the mainstream alternatives to that suck too. Join that up with the billionaire press in this country, and yeah. Not good. A lot of us simply not only see no representation of ourselves at all, we have almost daily attacks on our rights to exist everywhere we look.

To be clear I really respect people trying to make change in any of these big institutions. I’m just increasingly finding that this whole sorry mess is not something I care about any more, and most of the community organisers I work with locally feel the same. I think it’s time for us to go back to basics and figure out what community means again, as this is very often taken for granted.

Injecting big-P politics into our work unfolds in confusing and complex ways. Theres something inherently cringe feeling about doing *any* politics. I feel like everyone I talk to who does organising feels this in their soul. We do everything we can to avoid terms like 'activist' and spend an awful lot of time annoyed at other people. This talk made me cringe to write. But hey: I am cringe, but I am free.

People think of activism as protests or being obnoxious on Twitter, and for many that’s the front door, but we simply need to find better and more ways of being able to resist this sorry state of affairs that are inherently joyful, sustainable, inclusive, and can actualy pay people a wage to do. Ways that centre the needs of structurally marginalised groups and take us back to what really matters about all this: enabling collective joy.

### On the classed and gendered nature of free time

I was invited to talk at EMF under the 'EDI' (Equality, Diversity and Inclusion) banner, because some on the festival team realised it has a problem and wanted to make the festival better represent the UK’s wider population. There are a lot of structural reasons why this is the case -- the idea of it being someone’s “fault” is unhelpful here -- but it's important to be explicit about why this kind of initiative is important and what we hope to gain from investing in it. 

An ONS study showed that men have _five hours_ more leisure time a week than women every week. That’s a whole hobby. So there’s a side of this “free” labour that is radically classed and gendered, and tied to disposable income and caring responsibilities. Leisure time is therefore something people have highly varying quantities of and is drastically classed, gendered and probably racialised, before we even decide what to do with it.

> In 2015, men took, on average, 43 hours of leisure time per week, whereas women took around 38 hours of leisure time. (ONS, 2017, based on 2015 data)
>

[Men enjoy five hours more leisure time per week than women](https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/wellbeing/articles/menenjoyfivehoursmoreleisuretimeperweekthanwomen/2018-01-09)

I think this dynamic by itself results in so much of what we see unfold in terms of group makeup. And a lot of this is because of larger issues to do with the unequal distribution of care labour, unequal pay, etc. But it also ties into a disability activism narrative where if activities are uncritically based around the idea of the normal, normative, able bodied person, who [Grayson Perry coined “Default Man”](https://www.newstatesman.com/long-reads/2014/10/grayson-perry-rise-and-fall-default-man), we are just always going to be reproducing the harmful construct we’re placed within. 

Jos Boys talks about this basic tension in a disability studies context:

> Why does the idea of disability being creative and avant-garde seem so absurd? Is it because of the taken-for-granted assumptions about disabled people that they are in need of the help of others, are passive consumers of services, constitute a minority of individuals in society who (unfortunately) must bear the brint of their own medical problems? […] What if, instead, we see that rethinking disability enables us to explore critically and creatively assumptions about […] disability *and* ability, which, in turn, can offer better ways of understanding the […] implications of both bodily diversity and everyday social-spatial practice? (Boys, 2014[^boys])

### Why is this so hard!!!???!!!!!

Anyone whose tried to organise anything can attest to how utterly thankless it is most of the time. I think especially for the political spaces, a bunch of the following are common experiences I’ve heard over and over that I paraphrase here:

- "I tried to help out with some activist stuff, but everyone was just too busy yelling at each other and I didn't feel I could contribute"
- "People on the left are complete dicks and I got in shit for some stuff I don’t really understand and noone bothered to explain to me"
- "I tried to help out at a community centre but they were just really disorganised and never get back to me"

From the other side, for groups needing help this can be just as frustrating:

- "People keep coming to us with what they want to do and not asking what we need. The real issues here are complex and layered and don’t have simple fixes or someone would have done them."
- "We had a volunteer make a website but they didn’t really listen to us and noone knows how to operate it. We've now got to make a new one without upsetting anyone."
- "Volunteers keep coming and promising us the world and then vanishing. It makes it really hard to plan things and means we have to assume the worst a lot."

There’s no easy fixes to any of this stuff. Becuase of the vast underfunding of this sector by the Tories, groups can have an awareness they’re putting people off but don’t feel they can make the time to find out why. 

A lot of this though is simply because when you step outside normative contexts where people are in heirarchies and have similar social capital, you start dealing with actual breakdowns in society and that can be really jarring. Structural discrimination is very ugly, operates on multiple scales, and the dynamics have existed long before you were born and will continue long after. Putting your toe into it can feel like getting it bitten off. It takes a lot of hard work to do the work of decolonising yourself, unlearning racism, transphobia, classism, etc. In many ways it's a lifes work. Especially for white middle class people like me, meeting people where _they_ are that _they_ have the power can feel initially incredibly disconcerting. 

That’s where we’re trying to change things.

## Part 3: on Community Technology Partnerships

In the last section I’m gonna talk about GFSC’s approach to navigating all this stuff, and how we sort of want to take apart how people think about tech and put it back together again in a way that overcomes these ideas from the ground up. We’re still working through this and are very much at the start of our journey so please come talk to us about it. You can join our [discord server](http://discord.gfsc.studio) if you like, or send us a tweet or email!

### To recap...

On the surface of it it seems simple: tech and maker types have skills they enjoy using, and community groups have unmet needs that could be helped by these skills. Why then does it feel so incredibly hard to make these collaborations happen in reality? 

What we increasingly found developing GFSC was that the methodologies we have to do good work are just not fit for purpose. Design Thinking and Human Centered Design are two such approaches that proclaim to be liberatory but actually just end up revolving around the idea that what we need is expert white middle class able bodied people on high salaries to come and helicopter in and fix things and then leave. This is the kind of “uber, but for…” model. Uber, but for poverty. Yeah, no. 

### The Capability Approach

My earlier journal paper with Prof Stefan White built heavily on one key existential question:

> “What are the people of the group … actually able to do and be?
>  
> (Nussbaum, 1999[^whitefoale])

[^whitefoale]: Cited in: White & Foale (2020). [_Making a place for technology in communities: PlaceCal and the capabilities approach_](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/1369118X.2020.1767173#). Information, Communication & Society.

The Capability Approach is a human development methdology used by the UN and WHO for their sustainable development goals developed by Martha Nussbaum and Amartya Sen. This simple question asks what people are able to **be** and **do,** and asks how we can remove blockers to these concrete actions and states.

This seems like a simple question but is both a concrete ethical test that respects people’s fundamental existence, rather than having choices ‘made for them’ on the basis of external characterisation or assumptions of their abilities, feelings or opinions. By basing our work on this human development approach, rather than something from within product design or the tech industry, we think we’ve found a way to reconfigure this fundmental relationship in a wider (i.e. non technical and pre-existing) moral framework.

### Community Technology Partnerships

In other words, people are the best judges of their own personal circumstances and neighbourhood. They therefore are the best placed to fix it. Our approach to codifying this has three stages:

> 1. direct engagement with and involvement of,
> 2. multiple stakeholders in a place-based creative partnership,
> 3. actively enabling realisation of self-defined opportunities for individuals and groups. 
>
> (White & Foale, 2020[^whitefoale])

Essentially this means:

1. Talking directly with and engaging a range of people,
2. Getting them around a table[^table] in your neighbourhood in a way that allows decisions to be made collaboratively,
3. And in doing so enable everyone to achieve new things that they want both individually and as a group

[^table]: Or virtual equivalent, but the point is it's people you live close enough to to physically visit and create relationships with that are not soley around shared interests.

The explicit goal of this approach is therefore to increase collective power to act, to increase the things we can do or be. Have you ever felt like it’s not possible to get stuff done? And then moved to another city or a maker camp like this, or fell in with the right group of people, and suddenly you feel like you can do any number of things? This is what we’re getting at. How do we make places feel full of potential, creativity and joy? Beginning with inclusion and collaboration as a central principle creates the conditions for this.

I’ll give a few examples from our work of things that have come out of trying to work this way: by working with various local communities to develop projects. These are all things we've described on the blog before but hopefully makes this nascent approach we're describing concrete.

### Example 1: imok

We worked with No Borders Manchester to create a tool for their Signing Support Network. As part of the Tory government’s ‘hostile environment’ policy, people seeking asylum in the UK must regularly ‘sign in’ at one of 14 ‘signing centres’ around the UK. In Manchester, this is Dallas Court Reporting Centre.

This has repeatedly been described by people seeking asylum as the most dehumanising aspect of the whole asylum process. The #AbolishReporting hashtag is widely used on this issue by a variety of groups including Right to Remain and Migrants Organise. Reporting centres tend to be in the middle of nowhere with no seating or shelter for waiting family members or friends provided. On attending, an immigration official asks a range of inane questions that seem designed to waste everyone’s time, but can theoretically impact your case for asylum. 

If the government does decide to deport you, then you can be immediately detained from the centre and taken to the airport for extradition often with no recourse to a phonecall or way of notifying next of kin. This makes the entire process extremely stressful as it can happen at any time with no prior warning. Currently, No Borders Manchester and many other groups manually support individuals going through the signing process. This is obviously enormously labour intensive and requires a constant on-the-ground presence by volunteers.

imok is a simple bot designed to support people undertaking potentially risky activities. It’s primarily aimed at community groups working together to support these people. [You can read more about it on the launch announcement here](/2021/05/12/imok-is-launched.html).

The bot lets users ‘check in’ to the service with a messaging app or SMS message. If users don’t ‘check out’ after 30 minutes, it raises an alarm in a Telegram groupchat that project admins can join.

The partnership here was the existing No Borders coordination. They basically described to us exactly what they needed and we made it to fit in with the tools they already have (i.e. Telegram and mobile phones). We’ve sadly not been able to pilot this yet due to Covid-related politics and some changes in how the government operates but hope to soon.

[Read more about this project and find out how to support it here.](/2021/05/12/imok-is-launched.html). This shows an example of where the best tool for the job was not one centralised service, but rather a small tool that groups could adapt to their own circumstances. This dramatically increases security for users simply by ensuring that we don't know who is using it or where it's hosted -- 100 small things are a lot less of a security risk than 1 big one.

### Example 2: Taphouse TV Dinners

At the start of the Covid pandemic we were chatting to our frequent collaborators [The Old Abbey Taphouse](http://www.theoldabbeytaphouse.co.uk/) about food provision for vunerable residents, many of whom were pub customers now cut off from their neighbours and support networks. The pub's co-owner Rachele got together a group of volunteers to cook and deliver food using their then unused kitchen, and lots of promises of donations of food from various sources. 

This produced a huge logistical challenge though: how would we coordinate food donations, a dozen or so volunteers, management of dietry requirements, packing orders, delivery coordination, and promotion, all while in the beginnings of an unprecendeted pandemic? This challenge was exacerbated further through the lack of any financial support from the local institutions. So we were effectively trying to replace Deliveroo, but for free, during a pandemic none of us were prepared for. No small feat. 

TODO: add service design dia and photo

We worked with the partners on this project for a few weeks to create what ended up being a pretty simple service design (at least, for someone with service design skills), and an AirTable database to coordinate registration and delivery networks. We set up some basic SMS messaging for when orders were on the way and rang people on the scheme weekly to get their orders. These phonecalls ended up being almost as valuable as the food delivery itself as many were really struggling and isolated and needed someone to talk to.

This program has now delivered over 5,000 meals for free to residents despite an ongoing lack of support or acnowledgement from local institutions and almost no funding apart from donations from pub customers. This is an example where what was needed wasn't anything new or complicated, but needed the right design skills to be applied at the right time to the right problem. Even 'off the shelf' tools still need to be applied properly to the problem in question. This success came directly out of the existing relationship between the pub and GFSC and would not have been possible to 'helicopter in' any external designers who didn't have the full context or ability to work on a small project like this pro bono.

## Example 3: PlaceCal & The Trans Dimension

PlaceCal is our flagship piece of work we have been doing to develop the CTP idea, that we've talked about extensively in other places on the blog. I'll give a brief recap here to emphasise the methodological part of this work.

TODO: add PlaceCal xrefs

PlaceCal grew out of a parent project (MAFN) that wanted to examine the causes of social isolation and loneliness for older people within neighbourhoods in order to figure out how to combat them. This project spoke to over 6,000 people in Manchester and divested over £200,000 in funds directly to community groups.

A key finding was that people who were isolated commonly thought “There’s nothing to do in my neighbourhood!”. In communities up and down the country, this has led to social isolation and loneliness for a number of citizens, and therefore a lack of community resilience.

This is a big issue in the UK in particular, where it is estimated that 2 million older people will be lonely and isolated by 2024. Studies show that social isolation and loneliness is as bad for your health as smoking two packets of cigarettes a week.

Despite massive investments of time and money by big institutions such as city councils and health providers into event listings, asset maps and community directories, still no one could find out what was happening in their area.

We continued to work with age friendly partnerships in Hulme and Moss Side (our pilot area, where we are based) to find out why.

We found three big problems preventing effective information sources being created:

### People were working cross purposes

Every large institution was working on their own community information websites, with different organisations gathering the same data. This top-down approach of people in large institutions trying to gather information on small community groups was inefficient and missed out large swathes of activities and groups.

It also resulted in duplication, or several low quality results rather than one really good one. In fact, it means that every new institution attempting to make an 'asset map' or 'community directory' actually _adds_ to the burden on often unpaid community groups. These directories commonly provided no value for the groups themselves, and were percieved (we would say correctly) as an intelligence gathering exercise for the institutions creating them to "check up" on them for their benefit. By putting together large collections of arbritary low quality data on community group, various local community partnership workers could justify their existance to their bosses without actually improving the on-the-ground situation at all.

We realised this -- and not anything technical or digital -- was the main cause of the problem. Fixing it would require creating a collective, not-for-profit partnership of data publishers working together to overcome shared barriers, and institutions would need to work towards the goals of this group, not each institution's (often highly extractive) needs.

### Event software provided by institutions and corporations isn't fit for purpose

Existing community information websites provided by city councils, registered housing providers and public health teams were either on behalf of the groups by institutional staff through face-to-face meetings every six months, or required each group to complete lengthy, innaccessible and confusing forms for no clear benefit for each individual listings. Both approaches had enormous issues.

This meant that community groups had to input their information in one site for each provider either directly or via a community development worker, in addition to social media sites like Facebook, Twitter and Instagram, creating an ever-increasing amount of work for a very small amount of publicity.

We found out pretty quickly that almost everyone was already using some calendar software, or had something on their laptop or phone such as Google Calendar, Outlook 365, Facebook, Eventbrite, or a WordPress plugin of some kind. We therefore built our tool to use these as the inputs, so we would get a quick win/win by training someone to use something they already have (and are often paying for) better. PlaceCal then does the job of adding extra info about venues, wards and access info from context cues, and creates individual pages for each area and partner.

A really important side effect of this approach is that you don't have to log into PlaceCal at all to update events, but rather just edit a calendar you are already using. Anyone who has done hands on tech support with older people knows what a huge barrier creating accounts and remembering passwords is. We simply bypassed that by using an account people already had. This simple step enormously increased the quantity and quality of event data we were recieving compared to simply asking groups what events they had on they knew about.

### Tech skills are very low and digital inclusion initatives are directionless

Digital exclusion has affected community groups disproportionately, particularly in deprived areas such as Manchester. Groups often don’t have the skills or tools needed to promote themselves effectively. Rather than engaging with groups to find out what they want and supporting them, digital inclusion initatives have focussed on what the institution providing the training want, which is usually moving people to digital services instead of old face-to-face ones as a cost saving measure.

There is little strategic vision here with GMCA for example making the incredibly vague claim that people will be "100% digitally included". I assume this means the over 70s Fortnite league is just around the corner. Digital exclusion runs rife through big institutions, where many staff will freely admit that they either don't have or don't have the tools they need to do their job properly, and often have arbritrary bans on certain apps (Zoom or WhatsApp for example) that mean they're not able to meet groups where they are.

Many groups in our neighbourhood had never published anything online about their group's activities _at all_, relying completely on word of mouth and thereby missing out on many opportunities to connect with new and enthusiastic participants.

We therefore made a training program for institutions and community groups that builds on what they already have. We created an onboarding process for community organisers and groups, as well as a training manual. 

This worked amazingly well -- at our peak we were publishign 250 events per week just in two wards of Manchester (Hulme and Moss Side), and coordinated 2 huge winter festivals with a combined printed output from these groups going through 8,000+ doors in the area. Despite winning two awards for our work, we were unable to get followon funding for this project and so it stalled out for a few years.

TODO: link flyer

We've now found a new approach to funding this and are currently in the process of relaunching PlaceCal with two groups.

### The Trans Dimension

[add screenshots]

So I’m probably running out of time now but I’ll give an example of this:

We’re working with Gendered Intelligence, who are the biggest trans charity in the country (probably). 

They work in London and don’t want to continue just to grow and grow — they want to make a network of groups across the country.

We therefore helped them to set up a partnership of trans groups in London.

All the groups have been chatted to and we’ve now got this network. And a bunch of groups importing events. We have 26 groups and about 30 events per week. We did a survey before hand that found that in a poll of very online twitter people, the average groups trans people in london knew of was 3. So yeah. We think this will make a diff.

We’re launching this along with PlaceCal in July. And then we’re planning on using this as a gateway to working with groups in other countries that are happy to become this support organisation that onboards their area.

### Final thoughts: emergence and complexity

I’m really happy to announce we’ve won lottery funding over the next couple of years to spend working on this concept and approach. So hopefully this is just the start.

This work is really hard to talk about at the moment because we’re trying to create a basis for emergent systems, not deterministic ones, and we are barely off the starting blocks working on it. I’ll end on this quote from Joyful Militancy a friend sent:

> "the space beyond fixed and established orders, structures, and morals is not one of disorder: it is the space of emergent orders, values, and forms of life” (bergman & Montgomery, 2017)
> 

How can we disrupt the monopolisation of the internet by the big five tech companies and create our own structures based on mutual support, joy, inclusion and accessibility, that allow us to centre our basic desire as humans to create things?

I have no idea but ask us in a year.

## Talk to us!!

Let us know if you want to get involved in this kind of work. We’re working with this national partnership now.
